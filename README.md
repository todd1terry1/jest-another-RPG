# Jest-Another-RPG

# Description

In this module, I created a command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. My game will create new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, and also implement basic code tests using the Jest framework.
